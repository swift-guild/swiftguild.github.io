<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> February 17, 2026</p>

<p>This app is developed and operated by Swift Guild ("we", "our", or "the developer").</p>

<h2>1. Data Storage</h2>
<p>All food logs, macro tracking data, preferences, and settings are stored locally on your device.</p>

<h2>2. Health Data</h2>
<p>If you grant permission, the app may read from and/or write to Apple Health (HealthKit). Health data is used solely to provide app functionality and is never sold, shared for advertising, or transmitted to external servers.</p>

<h2>3. Analytics</h2>

<h2>4. Food Database Searches</h2>
